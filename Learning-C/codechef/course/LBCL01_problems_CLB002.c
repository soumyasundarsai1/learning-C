// Introduction
// Let us output an integer in C.
// C has a few lines of code which we write in almost all programs.
// These are the first 2 lines that you see in the program to your right. We are going to learn about them in some time.

// For now, read the Line 5: "printf("%d", 12);"

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  
  printf("%d", 12);
  return 0;
  
}
